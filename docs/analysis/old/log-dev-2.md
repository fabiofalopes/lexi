# Development Log: Refactor for LLM/Agentic Separation (Plan 2)

## Context & Intentions
This phase of the refactor implements Plan 2 (see plan2.md): separating all LLM logic from agentic workflow code. The goal is to make agent.py focused solely on orchestration, with all LLM provider logic, wrappers, and prompt sending moved to llm.py. This enables easier extension, testing, and future integration with other LLM providers or frameworks.

---

## 1. LLM Logic Extraction
- **Created `llm.py`:**
  - Moved all LLM-specific code (GroqLLMWrapper, simple_agentic_prompt, GROQ_MODELS) from agent.py to this new module.
  - llm.py exposes a clear interface for agentic workflows: `simple_agentic_prompt` and `GROQ_MODELS`.
- **Updated `agent.py`:**
  - Now imports LLM functions from llm.py.
  - All LLM implementation details are removed from agent.py.

## 2. Testing
- Ran the main workflow via main.py to ensure all agentic logic works as before.
- Verified that LLM calls, search/scrape/answer, and output saving all function correctly.

## 3. Results
- The codebase is now modular: agentic workflow and LLM logic are cleanly separated.
- LLM logic can be extended, swapped, or tested independently.
- The agentic workflow is easier to maintain and reason about.

## 4. Next Steps
- (Optional) Add an abstract LLM interface to support multiple providers.
- Add or update unit tests for llm.py in isolation.
- Continue to keep log-dev-2.md updated as further improvements are made.
