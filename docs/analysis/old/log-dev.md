# Development Log: Refactor of agent.py (Phases 1 & 2)

## Context & Intentions
This refactor was initiated to make the agentic workflow codebase more robust, maintainable, and extensibleâ€”not just to clean up the past, but to lay a strong foundation for future enhancements. Our goals included:
- Centralizing and standardizing prompts, configuration, and file handling.
- Reducing duplication and improving clarity in the core agentic logic.
- Making it easy to extend the system with new features, integrations (e.g., LlamaIndex), or advanced configuration.
- Ensuring that every run produces structured, reviewable, and reusable outputs.

This log documents the major refactoring steps performed on `agent.py` and related files, following the plan in `plan.md`, and is intended as a living record to support future development and innovation.

---

## 1. Prompt and Constant Centralization
- **Created `prompts.py`:**
  - All static system prompts and prompt templates (including dynamic prompt functions) were moved from `agent.py` to this new module.
  - Functions like `build_iteration_user_prompt`, `build_final_synthesis_prompt`, and `build_search_query_generation_prompt` are now imported from here.
- **Created `constants.py`:**
  - All filenames and directory names (e.g., `final_answer.md`, `scraped_content`) are now defined as constants in this module.
  - Used throughout `agent.py` for consistency and maintainability.

## 2. Scraped Content File Path Helper
- **Implemented `get_scraped_content_filepath`:**
  - Centralizes all logic for determining the correct file path for scraped content.
  - Handles slugification, uniqueness (with numbered suffixes), and legacy fallback names.
  - All places in `agent.py` that read or write scraped content now use this helper.

## 3. Parameter Review & Standardization
- **Standardized function signatures:**
  - Unified parameter names (e.g., `num_search_results_per_iteration` everywhere).
  - Ensured consistent defaults for model, temperature, output folders, etc.
  - Updated `main.py` and all workflow functions to use the new parameter names.

## 4. Testing
- **Tested via `main.py`:**
  - Ran the main workflow end-to-end after each major change.
  - Verified that outputs are correct and the refactor did not break functionality.

## 5. Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 2/3 of the refactor (output saving/logging helpers, config object, further modularization) as outlined in `plan.md`.

## 6. Output Saving Helper and Structured Outputs
- **Created `output_utils.py`:**
  - Implemented `save_run_outputs`, which saves all run outputs (final answer, all iteration details, run summary) in a standardized structure.
  - Ensures outputs are always saved in the correct place and format, reducing duplication and risk of errors.
- **Refactored `agent.py` workflows:**
  - Both `multi_agentic_search_scrape_answer` and `run_search_and_synthesize_workflow` now use `save_run_outputs` for all output saving.
  - Direct file writing for outputs was removed from these functions.
- **Tested and verified:**
  - Ran the workflow and confirmed that all outputs (`final_answer.md`, `all_iteration_answers.md`, `run_summary.json`, and `scraped_content/`) are created as expected and contain the correct data.

## 7. Next Steps
- Modularize the iteration logic by creating an `execute_single_iteration` function to further reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

## 8. Modularized Iteration Logic
- **Created `execute_single_iteration`:**
  - Encapsulates all logic for a single search/scrape/answer step (search, filter, scrape, aggregate, LLM call).
  - Returns the answer, URLs used, and any warnings/errors for each iteration.
- **Refactored main workflows:**
  - Both `multi_agentic_search_scrape_answer` and `run_search_and_synthesize_workflow` now use this helper in their iteration loops.
  - This reduces code duplication and makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

## 9. Configuration Management with AgentConfig
- **Created `AgentConfig` dataclass in `config.py`:**
  - Centralizes all agent configuration (model, temperature, iterations, output paths, API keys, etc.) in a single object.
  - Provides type hints and sensible defaults for all fields.
- **Refactored all main workflows and entry points:**
  - `run_search_and_synthesize_workflow`, `multi_agentic_search_scrape_answer`, and `main.py` now accept and use an `AgentConfig` object instead of many individual parameters.
  - All internal parameter usages now reference config fields, greatly simplifying function signatures and improving maintainability.
- **Result:**
  - The codebase is now much easier to extend, maintain, and reason about.
  - Future configuration changes or additions can be made in a single place.
